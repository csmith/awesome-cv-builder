= Awesome CV builder

This repo containers a Dockerfile designed to build CVs based on
https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV[posquit0/Awesome-CV],
because you probably don't want all those LaTeX dependencies
cluttering up your machine for an occasional CV edit.

Simply go to the directory with your CV source in, and run:

    docker run -u $UID:$GID --rm -v $PWD:/work csmith/awesome-cv-builder

This will take a `cv.tex` and produce a `cv.pdf`.

== Makefile

You probably won't remember that docker command when you come to
do another update months in the future, so why not create a Makefile?

[source,Makefile]
----
.PHONY: cv

CV_SRCS = $(shell find -name '*.tex')

cv: cv.pdf

cv.pdf: cv.tex $(CV_SRCS)
	docker run -u $(UID):$(GID) --rm -v $(PWD):/work csmith/awesome-cv-builder

clean:
	rm -rf *.pdf *.log
----

Then all you have to do is run `make`.
